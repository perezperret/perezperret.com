  - I'm a web developer from Caracas, Venezuela, traveling around the world and learning as much as I can.
    I'm currently learning portuguese, to play the guitar, to surf and to use Python for Machine Learning.
  - I specialize in full-stack web development using Ruby on Rails.
    I'm looking for early-stage projects to collaborate on as a consultant and full-stack developer.
    I'm also open to full time work.
  - My main areas of interest are financial technologies and developer tools. I'm happy to work on any kind of software,
    and I'm very good at quickly putting together useful and extensible MVPs and prototypes.

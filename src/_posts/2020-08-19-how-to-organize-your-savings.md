Standard advice disclaimer I suppose.

## 1. Insurance

- At a minimum, get some level of health insurance. Don't let an emergency derail the rest of your planning.
- Some other things to consider: auto, renter, liability insurance (for freelancers and contractors)

## 2. Emergency fund

Easy to access, 3 to 12 months of expenses.

- Cover unexpected expenses.
- In case of loss of income, cover living expenses while you figure it out.
- Adjust according to your experience.
- How long could you expect to stay unemployed? How long have recent job searches taken?
- How much can you make on the side while you search for something permanent? How much can you cut back your expenses while you're not getting any income?
- Should be able to put into your checking account in less than a week.

## 3. Retirement

- Seems crazy to think about this before 30, but at some point in your life you won't want, or be able to, make more money. The sooner you start taking care of this, the easier it will be.
- If you are 25, if you start consistently putting away 500 dollars a month for 40 years (aiming at retiring at 65
- You'll have saved 240,000
- If you invest this with a moderate return of 5% per year you'll compound that up to more than 740,000 (that is about 450000 in todays dollars)
- Put this in autopilot as soon as possible, and take opportunities to increase your savings rate and you'll be well set up.

## 4. Big ticket items

- Keep separate accounts to set money aside for bigger purchases: a long vacation or a sabbatical, a house downpayment, a second car.
- Set up a simple target date fund or an high yield savings account.

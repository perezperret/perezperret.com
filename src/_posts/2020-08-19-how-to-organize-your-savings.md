Having a nice mental model, and some numbers behind how I'm structuring my savings gives me a lot of peace. I was constantly getting that nagging feeling that I should be putting away as much as possible, and running the numbers helped me find a comfortable figure I can save each month to get started without feeling overwhelmed.

## 1. Insurance

As [I've written before](/how-to-start-saving), this is a no-brainer, if I'm going to take this seriously, I don't want an unexpected event to throw all my effort to waste. Currently I'm only getting health insurance (through [Safety Wing](https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance)) since I'm traveling around, and I'm planning to upgrade to something with outpatient coverage too soon. If you live in a country with universal healthcare this is already taken care of by your taxes, but there are other things to consider: auto-, renters-, or liability-insurance (for freelancers and contractors).

I think the trick here is to not hesitate, it's a big ticket and it'll only be worth it if something bad happens, which sucks, so instead of taking it as a gamble, just take it as a duty and get through with it.

## 2. Emergency fund

The first thing for me was to build a fund, which I have in an easy to access savings account in the US. Since I'm not a US resident, I haven't been able to open a high-yield account, which is terrible since my money is sitting there, losing value to inflation, but I take confort in the fact that I can solve most money problems that might come my way quite quickly.

If I'm out of work longer than usual or I have to travel back home fast, replace my computer or pay a rental deposit, it's not going to harm me.

Right now I have six months of expenses, this felt like a good figure for me because I stress a lot about money, but at the same time, I rarely go more than a month without finding projects. So six months is about right.

What I can recommend is to have a clear idea for how long it might take you to find a job, and a clear picture of how much you actually spend per month. I have found people are quite terrible at estimating their expenses unless they actively [track them](https://pocketpatch.io).

<!-- - Cover unexpected expenses.
- In case of loss of income, cover living expenses while you figure it out.
- Adjust according to your experience.
- How long could you expect to stay unemployed? How long have recent job searches taken?
- How much can you make on the side while you search for something permanent? How much can you cut back your expenses while you're not getting any income?
- Should be able to put into your checking account in less than a week.
- This is a problem I'd really like to solve. -->

## 3. Retirement

It seems crazy to think about this before 30, but I know at some point of my life I won't be able or willing to work. Most of my life I have acted like at some point in my life I'm going to hit a home-run and not need to worry about money ever again, but as I have consistently increased my income, I have realized this is a stressful approach. Instead I'm now trying to get my shit together, so I can take care of myself without needing more luck.

My approach is simple, I figured out how much I would need to start putting away each month, so that when I'm 65 (sorry Paul), I can cover my current expenses until I'm 85. To my surprise, I could start hitting this number today. I hope I can retire earlier than that, with a more confortable lifestyle than I have now, and I know my expenses are bound to grow with time, but knowing that this is my baseline gives a huge amount of peace.

I'm obviously going to try to grow this input, I'm going to have to figure out taxes and a lot of more stuff, but I have something I can get started on right now and put on auto-pilot. One thing I've learned recently is that there is nothing more powerful than something you can repeat consistently for years and years.

If on the one hand, your number seams out of reach, I feel you, I was there not long ago. The most important take away there in my opinion, is that you now know you're not actually making enough. That clarity is very powerful, and among other things, it should give you a confidence boost to ask for a raise or increase your rates.

If on the other hand, you run your numbers and you're already well above this, maybe you can start making bigger plans.

<!-- - If you are 25, if you start consistently putting away 500 dollars a month for 40 years (aiming at retiring at 65)
- You'll have saved 240,000
- If you invest this with a moderate return of 5% per year you'll compound that up to more than 740,000 (that is about 450000 in todays dollars)
- Put this in autopilot as soon as possible, and take opportunities to increase your savings rate and you'll be well set up. -->

## 4. Big ticket items

I'm not here yet, but I'm hoping to open a second savings account soon, where I can start putting away money for other stuff I want to do. The first one is to spend a year without working while I'm still young.

<!-- - Keep separate accounts to set money aside for bigger purchases: a long vacation or a sabbatical, a house downpayment, a second car.
- Set up a simple target date fund or an high yield savings account. -->

    I've worked for years as a developer, mostly building web applications and
    I've learned a lot of the technical in and outs, but I believe the most
    important lessons are not the technical ones.

    One of the most important such lessons has been that software development
    work is costly, so as a software developer, my labor is costly, and as
    such, I want to justify it with as much value added as possible.

    To achieve this, I propose a very simple system:

    1. For the first couple of weeks, I do purely consulting work: understanding
    your company or project, the problems you're facing, and how you think
    software (and my work as a developer) might help solve them. I'll come up
    with some proposals that may or may not involve furthe work from me.

    1. If we find a good opportunity for me to develop some software, either
    individually or as a part of your team, we come up with a plan to execute
    that. Often times, you won't need to write custom software to solve a
    problem, and that's perfectly fine.

    Since I'm just getting started with this system, I'm happy to do the two
    weeks consultation for free, starting with an informal meeting. Just
    [reach out](/contact)
